# Where's Waldo? - The Odin Project

This is an implementation of the classic 'Where's Waldo' game, where targets that are hidden within an image need to be found.

The front end of this application is based on React. The back-end uses Firebase to store map and target images, validate when targets are found, and store user high scores. The application is hosted on Firebase.
